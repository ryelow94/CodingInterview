# Coding Interview 
•	Create one button and three text fields (one for input, one for output and one for correction tally).
•	The user should be able paste the sample input, a monologue from Shakespeare's "As You Like It," into the input box.  
•	Clicking the button assigns an event that will find each occurrence of "his" and replace it with "his/her."  Bonus points for replacing the string "big manly voice" with "assertive voice."
•	The final updated monologue should be displayed in the output field.  
•	The "correction tally" field should display the total number of modifications made to the monologue by the script.  This should be formatted as a JavaScript Object with an attribute for the number of corrections.
	All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;
And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lin’d,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper’d pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well sav’d, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything
